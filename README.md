# Puzzle

This is a sliding puzzle game built on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The overall goal is to arrange the scrambled numbered slots in sequential order. Users can choose a simple game or a regular game. A simple game moves one slot out of place making it easy for users to solve the puzzle. A regular game (new game) scrambles all slots in a random order and users are meant to solve it. 
Features:
- There are 16 slots total, and one slot is empty. 
- Timer, in seconds, tracking how long took for the user to solve the puzzle.
- A counter that tracks the number of moves.
- Congratulations prompt after puzzle completion.
